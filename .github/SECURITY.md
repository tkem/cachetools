# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security updates are applied only to the latest release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have discovered a security vulnerability in this project, please report it privately. **Do not disclose it as a public issue.** This gives us time to work with you to fix the issue before public exposure, reducing the chance that the exploit will be used before a patch is released.

Please disclose it at [security advisory](https://github.com/tkem/cachetools/security/advisories/new).

This project is maintained by a single person on a best effort basis. As such, vulnerability reports will be investigated and fixed or disclosed as soon as possible, but there may be delays in response time due to the maintainer's other commitments.
